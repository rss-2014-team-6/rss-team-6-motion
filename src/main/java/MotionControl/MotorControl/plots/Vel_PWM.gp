# 1: Time since start of experiment (s)
# 2: PWM left motor -255..255
# 3: PWM right motor -255..255
# 4: Encoder Angular velocity left motor (rad/sec)
# 5: Encoder Angular velocity right motor (rad/sec)
# 6: Desired angular velocity left motor (rad/sec)
# 7: Desired angular velocity right motor (rad/sec)
